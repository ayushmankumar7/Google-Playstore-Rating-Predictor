Project Approach:

I sorted the important (required) list of attributes needed for our Machine Learning algorithm. 
Values which were object type , I encoded it.
Some object values were converted into float64 or int64.
With the "Reviews" CSV, I summed up the Sentiment polarity and all needed things which gave a really swift approach to handle that was Data.
Unfortunatly,  We had only aboout 800 Apps data in the Review Csv where as we had 10000 Apps data in the first CSV. 
Hence the accuracy Score isnt that good .

Algorithm Used:   ##Decision Tree Classifier
